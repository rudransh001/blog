                <h1>Google Watch is next year!!!</h1>
                <p> 

                  Accoring to new report from Insider, Google is finally making its own in-house smartwatch that’s set to launch in 2022. <br><br>
                  While Google has made its own smartphones for years under the Pixel line (which has since extended to other accessories, like wireless headphones),
                  the company has never designed its own smartwatch, despite the fact that Google has had a companion wearable platform for Android since 2014.<br><br>
                  The watch (codenamed “Rohan”) is being worked on by Google’s Pixel hardware group separately from Fitbit, which Google bought for $2.1 billion earlier this year. 
                  According to Insider’s report, the new upcoming Google watch — it’s not clear whether Google will actually be calling it a “Pixel Watch” yet — will serve much the same role as the Pixel phones do for Android: an example for both consumers and hardware partners of what Google’s software is truly capable of when given the right hardware. 
                  The device is expected to cost more than a Fitbit and compete more directly with the Apple Watch, according to The Verge’s source.<br><br>
